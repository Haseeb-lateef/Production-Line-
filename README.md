#Production and Delivery Management System  

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project simulates a production line system where products are manufactured across four separate lines. Each line outputs product data (name, weight, batch details, engine type, bin number, and price). The program then:

1.Reads product data from text files (line1.txt â†’ line4.txt).

2.Sorts each lineâ€™s products by weight (lightest â†’ heaviest) using Quick Sort.

2.Merges all four sorted lists into a single dispatch list (using a merge procedure).

3.Allows the user to search for a product in the dispatch list by its weight using Binary Search.

4.Outputs sorted lists per line and the merged dispatch list with product details.
